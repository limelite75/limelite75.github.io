               Do you and your child like hopping, dancing and excercising together while listening to happy music? Family Zumba is for you!
            </p>
            <p>
                Children need to move to stay healthy. Excercise has to be fun! The same is applicable for adults. 
                It is difficult as a parent of young children to get the time to exercise. 
                After a full time job and taking care of the household you also want time to socialize with your kids. 
                Family Zumba is a fun way to spend time with your child and exercise together.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Me and my 5-year old are working on putting together a choreo that will make both children and adults have fun and get a good exercise together. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Target group is 4-6 year-olds with a parent. But you know your child best. Perhaps your 3-year old likes to follow simple choreography. Perhaps your 7 year old wants to spend Sunday morning doing an activity together with you. You are welcome!
